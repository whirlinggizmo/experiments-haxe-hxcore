# Parking Lot

Backlog and deferred ideas for hxcore.

## Scripting
- Add an explicit unload->reload stash mechanism (vs ctx-only) for state carryover.
- Add dependency-aware hot-compile (edits to shared script dependencies should trigger recompiles).
- Expand JS HCR parity (loader refresh behavior + tests).
- Investigate no-file-IO environments (browser/wasm) for script delivery and reload.

## ECS
- TBD.

## Events
- TBD.

## IO
- TBD.

## Logging
- TBD.

## Utils
- TBD.

## Macros / Build
- TBD.

## Tests / Dev Workflow
- Add a formal process for identifying and pruning stale artifacts/logs in dev workflows.
- Document expectations for test output noise vs signal (e.g., intentional compile errors in tests).
